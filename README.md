# Berkeley Madonna microkinetic modelling
**5 experiment DM.zip** and **5 experiment DE.zip** contains individual time series data files used for microkinetic model fitting for diketone **1a** (DM) and diketone **1b** (DE) as well as the different iterations of the microkinetic models in Berkeley Madonna code format.

# Visualisation of all reaction data in MATLAB and python
**Reaction data.zip** contains all reaction data used to produce MATLAB surface plots including different excess experiments, reactant stoichiometry ramps, multivariate ramps, and steady state data points.
**Interactive scatter plot DM.ipynb** allows visualisation of the 3D reaction space as an interactive scatter plot on all reaction data.
**FinalModelFittingDM.m**, **FinalModelFittingDE.m**, and **SurfaceComparisonPlot.m** are MATLAB code for the final fitted microkinetic model response surface generation, and comparison between the surfaces for the two diketone substrates.
